/**
 * 
 * 1) make an array as MockTask and put some tasks inside it
 * 
 * 2) create a function named fetchTasks(), which returns tasks as a promise with 1 second delay.
 * 2-1) once you start your program the tasks inside the MockTask should display with 1 sec delay
 * 
 * 3) you need to create a function named renderTasks(tasks), to show the taken tasks as list's items on screen
 * 
 * 4) you should have an input for the clients to write their tasks inside, and add them to the list (MockTask array) with addTask button next to input.
 * 
 * 5)Implement the addTask(task) function to simulate adding a task to the MockTasks. Use a Promise to represent the asynchronous operation of adding a task.
 *5-1) your data should add to the list with 0.5 second delay

 * notice:
 * Ensure that when the "Add Task" button is clicked, the new task is added to the list of tasks and rendered on the webpage.
 * Ensure the initial list of tasks is fetched and rendered when the page loads.
